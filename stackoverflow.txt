Stackoverflow opened the "Documentation" section.

There was quite a significant event in the development scope yesterday. 
To tell specifically, in the area of support and maintenance of software. StackOverflow opened documentation section. Why is it important?

During the recent years, while github seized the market of distribution of source code, documentation problem was acute.

Despite the convenience of working with code, github couldn’t offer a decent documentation - wiki are thrown, and guide them through cvs too time-consuming. 

ReadTheDocs tried to solve this problem and haven’t done it, but was close. There is a gitbook, but it can hardly be called “standard”.

Today there are the following problems developers face with: 

The lack of a convenient way to conduct a multi-documents with complex navigation.
The need for interaction of many authors.
No single document design style. Just take Mongoose documentation - irritating color, poor syntax highlighting.
The need to select the storage and distribution.
Problems of "paper" work themselves.

Regarding StackOverflow offer, it appears that we’ll get  an interesting tool to solve the above problems and allows to make record keeping simpler process.  Opportunities: 

Joint development with support comparisons (diff).
The request for the creation of article.
Voting for change, instead of a single author.
The standard encouraging stackoverflow system.

We can only hope that soon we’ll have quality of docs and tedious and unpleasant process of conducting for some of us has finally become pleasant.
